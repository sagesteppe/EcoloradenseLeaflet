Hey! The best ideas come from folks that understand the data. To that end I have created a somewhat interactive website for applicants to explore these data! See this URL and follow the prompts as you click through! 

If you are a really space cadet, i.e. a spatial analyst, I have also included the raw point occurrence data in the `data\vector` directory. 
The data are present as a .kml () which can be opened in Google Earth Online (yay no downloads required!) or a geopackage file (), which is functionally equivalent to a shapefile and can be opened in QGIS (a free GUI GIS which is relatively small and easy to download to your computer). 
The raster data are quite large, and github won't host them for free. Wah-wah. However some more coarse versions of them are included in the folder ...
